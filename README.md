## Description

The CSS Battle project showcases an interactive overlay drawing feature on an image. The main components of the project include:

- `index.html`: The HTML file that defines the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that contains the styling rules for the web page.
- `solution.css`: The CSS file that provides additional styling for the solution div.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the interactivity of the overlay drawing.

The HTML file defines a container with an image and a drawing overlay div. The drawing overlay div can be resized and repositioned by interacting with the container. The overlay is initially transparent but can be made fixed by clicking on the container.

The CSS files provide styling for the various elements in the HTML file. The `style.css` file sets the background image, container properties, and general styles. The `solution.css` file provides additional styling for the solution div. Both files define styles for the overlay drawing.

The JavaScript file handles the interactivity of the overlay drawing. It detects mouse movements within the container and dynamically adjusts the size and position of the drawing div. The overlay can be fixed by clicking on the container, and it reverts to its original size and position when the mouse leaves the container.
